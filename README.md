## Bitcoin Price Prediction
This project predicts the future price of Bitcoin using machine learning techniques. It leverages a range of data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and models, including XGBoost for regression. The project provides tools to forecast Bitcoin prices based on historical trends and an option to specify a future date for predictions.

##Project Structure
bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and prediction steps.
bitcoin.csv - Dataset containing historical Bitcoin prices, with columns like Date, Open, High, Low, and Close.
main.py - Main Python script (optional) for executing predictions directly from the command line.
